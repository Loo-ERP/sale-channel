Prevent MRO conflicts by avoiding to define a new abstract model based
on the *se.indexable.record* model. This will prevent the MRO conflict when
one addon extends an existing model to make it indexable by inheriting from the
*se.indexable.record* model and another addon extends the same model and makes
it indexable by inheriting from a subclass of *se.indexable.record*.
